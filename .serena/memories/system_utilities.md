Common CLI utilities on macOS/Darwin:
- `git status`, `git diff`, `git add -p`, `git commit -m` for VCS.
- `ls`, `pwd`, `find`, `rg` (ripgrep) for navigation/search; prefer `rg` for code lookup.
- `npm` and `supabase` CLIs installed globally; use `npm run <script>` from `inventorymanagement/`.
- Shell default is `zsh`; prefix workspace commands with `bash -lc` when scripting via tools.
